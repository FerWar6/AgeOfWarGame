I created this game because my favourite flash game was Age Of War.
I challanged myself to recreate the game in C++.
This is my first time ever using C++.

How to use:

Clone the project.

In the AgeOfWar folder, open the command prompt and type `premake5 vs2022`. If you have another version change the `vs2022` with your version of visual studio. 

Open the solution file and run it on release.
